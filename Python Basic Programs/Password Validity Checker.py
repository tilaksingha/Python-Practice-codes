'''
A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a
program to check the validity of password input by users. Following are the criteria
for checking the password:
1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will
check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to
be printed, each separated by a comma.
Example
If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
Then, the output of the program should be:
ABd1234@1
'''
import re
# Function to check if a password is valid
def is_valid_password(password):
 # Check the length of the password
 if 6 <= len(password) <= 12:
 # Check if the password matches all the criteria using regular 
    if re.match(r"^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[$#@])", password):
        return True
 else:
    return False
# Accept input from the user as comma-separated passwords
passwords = input("Enter passwords separated by commas: ").split(',')
# Initialize a list to store valid passwords
valid_passwords = []
# Iterate through the passwords and check their validity
for psw in passwords:
 if is_valid_password(psw):
    valid_passwords.append(psw)
    # Print the valid passwords separated by commas
    print(','.join(valid_passwords))

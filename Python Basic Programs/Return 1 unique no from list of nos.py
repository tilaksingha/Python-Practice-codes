'''
Create a function that takes a list of numbers and return the number that's unique.
Examples
unique([3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3]) ➞ 7
unique([0, 0, 0.77, 0, 0]) ➞ 0.77
unique([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) ➞ 0
Notes
Test cases will always have exactly one unique number while all others are the same.

    else:
        count_dict[num] = 1
 
 # Find the unique number (occurs only once)

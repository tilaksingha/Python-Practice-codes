# Accept input from the user
input_sequence = input("Enter a comma-separated sequence of words: ")
# Split the input into a list of words
words = input_sequence.split(',')
# Sort the words alphabetically
sorted_words = sorted(words)
# Join the sorted words into a comma-separated sequence
sorted_sequence = ','.join(sorted_words)
# Print the sorted sequence
print("Sorted words:", sorted_sequence)
